Predictive Modeling of Deforestation Risks Using LSTM, CNNs, and Random Forests

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning and machine learning techniques to detect, classify, and predict deforestation using satellite imagery and time-series data. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 3D CNNs, LSTM networks, and Random Forests, the project aims to support environmental monitoring and guide conservation efforts through data-driven insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

Classify forested vs deforested regions using Sentinel-2 imagery.

Detect temporal changes in forest cover using Landsat image sequences.

Predict future deforestation risks using sequential and structured data.

Enhance model performance through data preprocessing and augmentation.
